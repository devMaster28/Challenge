# Challenge

## Dependency reason

Knowing that the number of dependencies is valued, I have tried to use the minimum possible 

### @notifee/react-native
To be able to use notifications

### react-native-svg , react-native-svg-transformer

To be able to use SVG


## Preconditions

### 1. sdk  31
The reason is because the Notification dependency works on a higher sdk
