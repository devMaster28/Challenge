# Challenge

## Dependency reason

Knowing that the number of dependencies is valued, I have tried to use the minimum possible 

#### @notifee/react-native
To be able to use notifications

#### react-native-svg , react-native-svg-transformer

To be able to use SVG


## Preconditions

####  sdk  31
The reason is because the Notification dependency works on a higher sdk 

####  Listen the 8081 port
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081

the fetch peticion doesnt allow to fetch 

## Notes

For the backend , the websocket endpoint I have put it slower because every time a data is received a notification is generated 

Regarding the tests one has been started. But since it is true that I have no experience, I decided that the best thing would be to present without the tests. Before the possible second interview I would work on it
